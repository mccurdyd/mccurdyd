**Desktop Support Engineer | Building Automation Tools | Transitioning to DevOps**

I automate IT operations and build tools that reduce manual work in enterprise environments. My background in desktop support gives me real-world context for the problems I solve through scripting and automation.

## What I Actually Do

I write PowerShell and Python tools that automate:
- User provisioning and migration workflows
- Device inventory and reporting
- Active Directory management
- Integration with SaaS platforms (Monday.com, Microsoft Graph)

My scripts handle real production workloads and are designed for reliability, error handling, and logging.
